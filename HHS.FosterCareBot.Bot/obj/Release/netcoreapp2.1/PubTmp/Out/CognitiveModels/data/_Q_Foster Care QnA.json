      "answer": "\"You can ask a few preliminary questions over the phone (fees and ages of children, for example), but you won't really get a sense of what a daycare place is like until you go there and meet the staff and director. Ask daycare center directors and caregivers and home daycare providers about everything from hours, fees, and vacation schedules to philosophies on childrearing issues like discipline, feeding, and sleeping. Get a schedule of the day's activities and the center's policies. Pay attention to your gut feeling and how the director or caregiver handles the questions. Ultimately, choosing a daycare is a very personal decision. Our checklists highlight specifics, but basically, you'll want a warm, clean, safe environment and experienced teachers who are paid well and happy with their jobs. Children crave consistency and need to form strong relationships with their caregivers, so you don't want teachers who come and go. Pay attention to the caregiver-child ratios, and how many children are in a classroom.\"",
